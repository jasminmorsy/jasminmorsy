    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>My name is Jasmin. I am 22 years old. I am currently in my second year doing Journalism and Media (BA). I grew up in Vienna in Austria but have been living in London for several years now. Besides studying I also work as a German tutor.I am not sure what exactly I want to do once I finish my course, but I know I want to work in media and do something creative. 
    </p>   
    
    <p>My hobbies include yoga, reading, photography, meeting new people, learning new things and seeing new places and above all spending time with my friends.
